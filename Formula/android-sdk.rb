    We agreed to the Android SDK License Agreement for you by downloading the SDK.
    If this is unacceptable you should uninstall.

    License information at:
    https://developer.android.com/sdk/terms.html

    The Android-SDK location for IDEs such as Eclipse, IntelliJ etc is:
      #{prefix}

    You may need to add the following to your .bashrc:
      export ANDROID_HOME=#{opt_prefix}

    If you haven't already done so, you will probably want to:
      brew install toonetown/android/android-platform-tools toonetown/android/android-build-tools
    And you probably want to install one of the toonetown/android/android-platform-XX packages too
